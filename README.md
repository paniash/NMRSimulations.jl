### NMRSimulations.jl

This repository contains all the code used to generate plots and numerically solve the relevant differential equations for NMR experiments.

`bloch.jl` contains code for understanding and plotting the time-variance of the components of magnetization in the rotating frame.

`src/total.jl` contains code for solving and plotting the probability of spin-orientation, flipping probability and the Fourier transform for the same.
